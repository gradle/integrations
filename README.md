# Gradle Integrations

A repository for Gradle Build Tool integrations,
wishlist for the new integrations, and the related knowledge base.

We will use this repository to move over the ideas of generic plugin integrations submitted in other repositories,
when they do not fit the scope of the dedicated repositories.
If you wish to work on any of the specificed integration,
you are more than welcome to do so!
